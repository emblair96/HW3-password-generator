# HW-password-generator

## Description of work completed
In this assignment, I created the logic for the generatePassword() function in the script.js file.  This function generates a random password for users based on their choice of password criteria.  The live site can be found [here](https://emblair96.github.io/HW3-password-generator/).  

## Areas for improvement
After generating the first password, the password is preceded by the following: object HTMLTextAreaElement.  I understand that this is displaying the type of HTML element that passwordText is accessing in the index.html file, however, I'm not sure why.  Any subsequent passwords generated after the first do not include this element identifier.  I will continue to debug the code to solve this issue.

## Credits

I would like to credit my Northwestern Bootcamp instructor, Lori Culberson, and the TAs for the course, Tony and Pat, for helping me learn the foundations of JavaScript.
